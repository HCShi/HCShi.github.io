<hr>
<p>Haichao Shi (Student Member, IEEE) received the B.S. degree in software engineering from Beijing Technology and Business University, Beijing, China, in 2017. I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in cyberspace security with the National Engineering Laboratory of Information Content Security Technology, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing. My research interests include action detection, action recognition, re-identification, etc.
